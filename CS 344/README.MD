CS 344, aka Operating Systems I. What a nightmare this class was.
I heard shortly after Spring 2023 they are revamping the course, its getting
a new name and new course number, and of course, new content. I can only say,
good... This was the hardest class in the program, and according to some staff
at OSU, one of the hardest classes in undergrad courses overall. 

It was 5 projects in C, on the class server, via VIM. I left out one where we had to mimic the "TREE" utility
found in UNIX. Why did I do that? A lot of the backend code was the "professors"
and I did not feel comfortable commiting his code. 

That being said, all of these 4 other projects were standalone. Anyone who took this
class and hears the word "smallsh" muttered, instantly gets some flashbacks. What a horrible, painful
tedious assignment. The class was very antiquated, some projects (smallsh, OTP) being around 15 years old.
More than due for an update. I feel as though all of us who made it through the pre-revamped version
were but through the mill, but came out stronger. That being said, I never want to touch C again.

Anyway, despite my code here being VERY messy, lacking comments, lazy, and probably horrible, I'm the most
proud of these projects over any other course projects, except maybe 261's AVL.

#1 Base64: Simple assignment, mimic the base64 encoder found on many shells.

#2 TREE: Mimic the Tree utility found on many shells, left out because alot of backend code was profs.

#3 smallsh: What can I say other than the hardest college assignment I've ever done. Someone proficient in C
might look at this project and laugh, but get in my and other students shoes, who have been coding in C
for 3 weeks and then we have to make our own shell. Thats what it was, making our own C shell with
forking, custom commands (exit, cd, et...) background processes, childs, etc. 

#4 Multi-threaded Consumer Producer Pipeline: Hey, I got past smallsh. I'll take anything now!
Fun assignment, you need to make a program with 4 threads, that edit chars. 

#5 One-time-pad Client Server: Another fun assignment, but difficult, the oldest assignment of the bunch, current professor
estimating it is 15 years old in the program. Mimic a client and a server encrypting and decrypting data. THE RED GOOSE FLIES AT MIDNIGHT STOP
is forever engrained in my mind. Had to spend a lot of time learning networking, sockets, etc..
