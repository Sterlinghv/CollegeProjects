CS 162, at the time called "Introduction to Computer Science 2":

This class was fairly easy, and I had already been programming for quite a while
before ever taking it. The class focues around OOP, recursion, and linked lists.

I've showcased what I deemed as some of the more interesting projects in this course.

The final project was to re-create the game "Mancala" in code. It did not take me
very long, only about an hour or so. I still think its somewhat neat, but it
was not a very hard "final project". There were weeks where our assignments
were much more difficult, such as the recursion and linked list weeks.

The "Library" project was more OOP heavy, but also on the easy side.

Overall a decent class.
