CS 261, at the time it was named "Data Structures" and yeah, that pretty 
well sums up the course. It was essentialy 6 assignments involving different
data structures. I left out the beginning assignment.

I could go on and on in great detail about each of these structures, but I wont.
If you are interested enough, feel free to look them up or trace the logic
in my code. I will say AVL was a particularly interesting one, and the hardest. 
I mean, the AVL tree was invented in the 70's by a Soviet guy, so it makes sense
it would be somewhat complex. 

Hash Map was the last assignment and supposed to be our portfolio, but
AVL feels much more like a portfolio project to me.
