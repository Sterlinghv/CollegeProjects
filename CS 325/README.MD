CS 325, at the time calles "Analysis of Algorithms". I wont  talk too much
about this course, it is what it was, an algorithms class. Much of it felt
like medium to hard level leetcode problems, which I did not mind. The assignments
usually did not require much code, but much like CS 261, required a decent amount
of researching how the data structure and algorithm worked. 

Our portfolio assignment was the Puzzle.py project, but I enjoyed and felt a lot
more challenged on the DNAMatch.py dynamic programming assignment.
